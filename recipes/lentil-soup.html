    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This soup recipe was a long time coming! Over the years, I made some lackluster lentil soups that never saw the light of day on this website. No vegetarian food blog would be complete without a proper lentil soup, though, so I perfected one of my own.</p>
    <p>I'm just really hungry. It's 3:42 in the morning, and I haven't eaten in so long and now I'm craving some lentil soup. Also, took my meds today lol.</p>
