        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Authentic Chimichurri is a traditional recipe from Uruguay & Argentina, where it’s a staple accompaniment to grilled meats, especially churrasco (grilled beef) at any asado (barbecue). Chimichurri is a vibrant, tangy, and herbaceous oil-based condiment that brings a burst of fresh flavors to any dish. The dominant notes come from fresh parsley, garlic, and oregano, giving it a bright and aromatic quality.</p>
            <p>This recipe is particularly special for me because it's the first recipe (that I remember!) my dearest friend, Alexandros, ever teaching me. I recently made it myself and it turned out fantastic, though I had to <strong>hand grind</strong> all of the herbs and spices because I saw him use a blender and, freshly moved into a new apartment and missing a blender of my own, I thought this was a necessary step!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Vinegar</li>
                <li>Oil</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Parsley</li>
                <li>Pepper</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Red Chili</li>
                <li>Oregano</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix all ingredients together in a bowl. Allow to sit for 5-10 minutes to release all of the flavours into the oil before using. Ideally, let it sit for more than 2 hours, if time allows.</li>
                <li>Chimichurri can be prepared earlier than needed, and refrigerated for 24 hours, if needed.</li>
                <li>Use to baste meats (chicken or steaks) while grilling or barbecuing. We don’t use it as a marinade, but choose to baste our meats with chimichurri instead. However, you can use it as a marinade if you wish. Also, add a couple of tablespoons over your steak to serve.</li>
            </ol>
