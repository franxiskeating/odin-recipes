        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Authentic Chimichurri is a traditional recipe from Uruguay & Argentina, where it’s a staple accompaniment to grilled meats, especially churrasco (grilled beef) at any asado (barbecue). Chimichurri is a vibrant, tangy, and herbaceous oil-based condiment that brings a burst of fresh flavors to any dish. The dominant notes come from fresh parsley, garlic, and oregano, giving it a bright and aromatic quality.</p>
            <p>This recipe is particularly special for me because it's the first recipe (that I remember!) my dearest friend, Alexandros, ever teaching me. I recently made it myself and it turned out fantastic, though I had to <strong>hand grind</strong> all of the herbs and spices because I saw him use a blender and, freshly moved into a new apartment and missing a blender of my own, I thought this was a necessary step!</p>
